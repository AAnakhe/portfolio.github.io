# My Portforlio Website
This is a website sharing highlights of my tech journey so far, it outlines a detailed description of my resume, my experiences, a list of projects I have worked on, my skills and services I render, testimonials from the many amazing people I have worked with and also articles from my blog. 

Lastly it contains my contact details for potential clients and recuiters to reach me. It will be updated from time to time to reflect new realities as I progress on this life long journey building apps and softwares that solve world problems.
